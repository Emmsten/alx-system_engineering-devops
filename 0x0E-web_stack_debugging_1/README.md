#### Stack Debugging: Tracing the Source of Errors

When debugging an issue in your code, it's important to know how to trace errors back to their source. One way to do this is by using the "call stack" or "stack trace."

A call stack is a list of all the function calls made in a program up to the point where an error occurred. By reading the stack trace, you can see the sequence of function calls that led to the error.
