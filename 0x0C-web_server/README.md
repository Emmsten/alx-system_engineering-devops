# Web Server Project

This project is focused on setting up, configuring, and deploying a web server to host a web application. It includes tasks ranging from basic server setup to more advanced configuration like security enhancements and performance tuning.

## Project Description

The Web Server Project is designed to provide practical experience with technologies such as Nginx or Apache, configuring them to serve web content, and securing the connections using SSL/TLS. This project will also cover load balancing and basic server monitoring.

## Features

- **Basic Server Setup**: Installing and configuring a web server on a Linux environment.
- **SSL Configuration**: Securing the server with HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Load Balancing**: Introduction to load balancing techniques with practical implementation.
- **Server Optimization**: Tuning the web server for better performance under load.
- **Monitoring**: Setting up basic monitoring tools to keep track of server performance and uptime.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu preferred)
- Access to a terminal/command line
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. **Install a Web Server**:
   - For Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nginx
     ```
   - For Apache:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install apache2
     ```

2. **Start the Web Server**:
   - Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     ```
   - Apache:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start apache2
     ```

3. **Verify the Server is Running**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the default welcome page.

### Configuration

Detailed steps to configure the web server for various functionalities like SSL setup, load balancing, and server optimization are included in their respective directories within this project.

## Usage

After installation and configuration, your web server is ready to host web applications. You can now deploy your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files by placing them in the web server's root directory (typically `/var/www/html`).
