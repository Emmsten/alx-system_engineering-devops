## Getting Started

To begin debugging your web application, follow these general steps:

1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to reproduce the problem consistently. Note down the steps that lead to the issue.

2. **Use Browser Developer Tools**: Open the browser's developer tools (usually accessible via F12 or right-click > Inspect) and start inspecting elements, checking console logs, and analyzing network requests.

3. **Check Server Logs**: If the issue is related to server-side code, check server logs for errors or unexpected behavior.

4. **Narrow Down the Problem**: Use a process of elimination to narrow down the root cause of the issue. Temporarily remove or comment out sections of code to see if the problem persists.

5. **Search for Solutions**: Look for solutions to similar problems online. Websites like Stack Overflow and developer forums can be valuable resources.

6. **Experiment and Test**: Once you have a potential solution, test it thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue without causing new problems.
