#### HTTPS SSL: Secure Your Site with HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used to communicate between a web browser and a web server. It provides end-to-end encryption, which protects sensitive data from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.

To enable HTTPS on your website, you will need to obtain an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate and install it on your web server.
